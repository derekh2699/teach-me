# Teach Me

## Description
**Teach Me** is a software project designed to connect users to teach each other creative skills. **Teach Me** provides creatively skilled individuals (musicians, artists etc.) with an additional source of income, while allowing non-skilled individuals to explore skills that they might be interested in learning.

## History
The idea behind **Teach Me** came from observing a simple problem evident in our society today- that while we are often interested in creative pursuits at a young age, as we grow older, we are *encouraged* to set them aside in favor of more financially rewarding activities.

Those who continue to pursue their passions, whether they are dramatic, musical or craft-based in nature, often find themselves experiencing financial hardship. On the other hand, those who choose to focus on maximizing their financial gain are yearning to discover (or rediscover) their creative potential. By connecting these diverse groups of people, **Teach Me** seeks to bridge the gap and help our teachers improve their financial security, and our learners to rekindle their passions for all things creative and fun.
