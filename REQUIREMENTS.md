### End User Observations
---
#### Persona1:
- Brian Booth is a college student with fair amount of free time, and he would like to learn how to code in Python without taking classes in this university. He has tried various methods to achieve his goal, but there are flaws for method. Searching up videos on YouTube easy and free, but there when Brian needs further explaination on a problem or when he fails to solve a bug, there is no one to help him. As a college student, Brian thinks that the paid online courses are costing too much. He wish there is a place where he can learn the basics without guidance but not paying too much.

#### Persona2:
- Mattie Lopez is a college student who is also a very skilled guitar player. She would like to teach others how to play this instrument. She has thought of recording videos and publish it online. However, she would prefer to have some income from teaching these classes. In addition, she would also want to browse other classes avaliable.
