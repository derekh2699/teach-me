# Contributing

All contributions made to this repository are welcomed and appreciated. Nonetheless, the following information and rules should be kept in mind when making a contribution:

## Team values
1. Respect each other and treat each other as equals.
2. Accept constructive criticisms and welcome different viewpoints.
3. Be responsible for the work you have been assigned.
4. Be proactive in helping, collaborating with and communicating with others.

## Definition of done
All codes for User Stories must (1) satisfy all the requirements, (2) be reviewed by other members of the team and (3) pass automated tests before merging into master.

## Standup schedule
In-person standups will occur on Tuesdays and Thursdays after class, as well as on Fridays at 6pm; remote standups will occur on Sundays at 6pm.

Team members are expected to appear on time for standups. All absences should be communicated through Slack prior to the standup.

## Resolving conflicts
Should conflicts occur during any part of the development process, they should be discussed immediately within the team. If the team is unable to reach a consensus, a vote - following a simple majority rule - will be taken to find the solution that most members agree with. 

## Communication
Team members should communicate with each other regularly through Slack and respond to messages in a timely manner.

## Git workflow
Addition of any new features to the program should first be completed in a branch. Merging the said branch with master requires review and consent from fellow team members. After each merge, README.md should be updated to include the changes that have been made.
